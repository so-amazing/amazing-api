                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.  The license was designed to
 guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make
 sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
 License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software
 and to any other software whose authors commit to using it. (Some
 other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser
 General Public License instead.)

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
 forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
 these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
 for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the software, you must give
 the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that
 they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
 these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with the hope that you
 will contribute to the software. By doing this you help ensure that
 everyone can use the software in freedom.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
     of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     "You" refers to the licensee, or to the individual or legal entity
     exercising permissions granted by this License. For example, "you" could
     be the original author of the Program or the one who modified it.

     "License" means the act of making the software available to others.

     "Source code" means the preferred form for making modifications to the Program.
     It includes the complete source code for all modules it contains, plus
     any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
     compilation and installation of the executable, or other materials
     necessary to make modifications to the software.

     "Object code" means any form of the Program that is not source code.

     "Executable" means any object code or source code that is compiled into
     a form that can be executed.

     "The General Public" means the entire public, whether users or developers.

  1. Source Code.

     The Program must have a source code. You can get it by requesting it from
     the distributor. If you redistribute the Program, the recipient must also
     receive or have access to the source code. This ensures that anyone can
     inspect and modify the software.

  2. Modifications.

     You are free to modify the software. However, any modifications must also
     be licensed under the GPL, and must also come with the same permissions,
     meaning the rights must not be restricted by the new author.

  3. Redistribution.

     You can redistribute the Program under the terms of this License. You must
     keep intact all the notices related to the GPL and other notices that
     protect the author's rights.

  4. Copyleft.

     Copyleft is a key concept of the GPL. When you distribute or publish
     copies of the Program or its modifications, you must pass on the same rights
     and distribute the software under the same GPL license. This ensures that
     everyone gets the same freedoms.

  5. No Warranty.

     There is no warranty for the software. If the Program is modified or
     changed in any way, the author is not liable for any problems or issues
     resulting from those modifications.

  6. License Termination.

     If you violate the terms of this License, the permissions granted by this
     License automatically terminate, unless you receive permission from the
     copyright holder to continue using the Program.

  7. Additional Terms.

     You may add additional conditions to this License, as long as they do
     not conflict with the terms set out in this License.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be covered by this License,
  just apply the GPL terms to it. You may copy this text and apply it to your
  software. If you change the program, be sure to modify the version number,
  so it’s clear which version of the GPL you’re using.
